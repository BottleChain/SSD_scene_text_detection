## SSD_scene-text-detection

The note about the original paper: [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) can be found [here](http://blog.csdn.net/u010167269/article/details/52563573).

This practice is inspired by [ssd-plate_detection](https://github.com/hyh21521038/ssd-plate_detection)

The detail of the above code can read my blog: http://blog.csdn.net/u010167269/article/details/52851667, which was written in chinese.

Meanwhile, I have uploaded my training caffemodel to BaiduYun, Google Drive, Dropbox.

Some examples of the scene text detection:

## Note
Currently, I mainly focus on image/video captioning.
